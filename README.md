# hector
A [discord.js](https://discord.js.org) bot that (will) implement little board
games (only speaks french as of today)

# Usage
This bot needs the [discord.js](https://discord.js.org) library:

```
$ npm install discord.js
```

To configure the bot, copy `config.json.example` to `config.json` and replace
all placeholders (values surrounded by chevrons `<>`) by actual relevant values
for your context (please remove the chevrons when you do so).

You can then launch the `run.js` file with nodejs, for example in a terminal on Linux:

```
$ node run.js
```
