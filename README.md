# Hector
A [discord.js](https://discord.js.org) bot that (will) implement little board
games (only speaks french as of today)

Its name comes from the second gym leader from Pokémon gold/silver:
[Bugsy](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Bugsy) (whose french name is
Hector). Bugsy is a gym leader, perfect for a bot that is a game master, and
he specializes in Bug-type Pokémon, making him full of bug, perfect for a bot
made by someone whose using that project to learn javascript (and that would be
me).

# Usage
This bot needs the [discord.js](https://discord.js.org) library:

```
$ npm install discord.js
```

To configure the bot, copy `config.json.example` to `config.json` and replace
all placeholders (values surrounded by chevrons `<>`) by actual relevant values
for your context (please remove the chevrons when you do so).

You can then launch the `run.js` file with nodejs, for example in a terminal on Linux:

```
$ node run.js
```
